##Cloud Music
by Kyle Vanderburg
This research/creative project is piggybacked on NoteForge Liszt, which requires some disclaimers:

Disclaimer 1:
Use of this code does not create a business relationship between you and NoteForge. Sorry. Of course, by extension, you don't have to pay for it. Yay! 

Disclaimer 2:
This software won't work out-of-the-box. Because so much of it is based on Liszt functions and classes (which are not included for, y'know, business-y reasons), you'll have to tweak this code to make it work. I'll try to document those areas that aren't clear.

Disclaimer 3: 
This project is released without warranty of any type.

Otherwise, knock yourself out.
