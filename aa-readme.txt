Cloud Music - Kyle Vanderburg
This research/creative project is piggybacked on NoteForge Liszt, which requires some disclaimers:

Disclaimer 1:
Use of this code does not create a business relationship between you and NoteForge. Sorry. Of course, by extension, you don't have to pay for it. Yay! 

Disclaimer 2:
Cloud Music (CM) is exempted from the Liszt Terms of Service at https://noteforge.com/legal/liszt-terms-of-service/. The license most appropriate is likely the Community Research and Academic Programming License (CRAPL) as outlined at http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/.

Disclaimer 3:
This software won't work out-of-the-box. Because so much of it is based on Liszt functions and classes (which are not included for, y'know, business-y reasons), you'll have to tweak this code to make it work. I'll try to document those areas that aren't clear, but I make no guarantees, because...

Disclaimer 4: 
...This project is released without warranty of any type, and if you use this code to fail in spectacular fashion I won't even admit that I've heard of this project before.

Otherwise, knock yourself out.
